14.9.1 ALPHA 1
	Prescia is created from the base files of a new implementation of my framework based of Version 3 "Nekoi" (a.k.a. Aff), which was based from Version 2 "Sora", based on Version 1 "Akari"
	Most of the core was heavily changed not only in function but also form to make it more readable for an open source, thus bugs were certainly introduced
