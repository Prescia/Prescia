TODO list is on site/github

14.9.25 BETA 0.7 (stable - finishing bi_bb, first release!)
	Mostly about the new bi_bb module
	Several weird bugs on notifyEvent scripts, including the raw system
	Some bugs on data parsing and user creation/edit events
	(pending: array add/edit on serialized fields)
14.9.14 BETA 0.7 (not stable - testing new module sql handlers)
	New module::get_base_sql handling of sql using only arrays to prevent sql_break at the end (faster)
	New module::get_advanced_sql function to build smart SQL based on a tag of required fields instead of returning all
	Multiple bug-fixes, including automatic maintenance no longer will delete orphan files (local version might have file backup but no sql backup)
	(pending: array add/edit on serialized fields)
14.9.12 BETA 0.6
	New serialized field support
	Better multi-key handing at module level
	Multiple bug-fixes
	BUG REPORT: bot protection not working, upload treatment with "issues", bi_adm title bar is vanishing on search
14.9.1 ALPHA 1
	Prescia is created from the base files of a new implementation of my framework based of Version 3 "Nekoi" (a.k.a. Aff), which was based from Version 2 "Sora", based on Version 1 "Akari"
	Most of the core was heavily changed not only in function but also form to make it more readable for an open source, thus bugs were certainly introduced
