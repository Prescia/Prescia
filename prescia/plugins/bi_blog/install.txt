Add this to your pages.xml on the FOLDER of the Blog. Replace [folder] at the automato definition with the blog folder. 

Note that if no index.html is present for that folder, it will use the default one inside the payload

Don't forget to add any links you need at the LINK automato. You can also personalize the FRIENDLYURL as you wish

<[folder]>
	<LINK>....,affbiblog.css</LINK>
	<FRIENDLYURL>
			<MODULE>blog</MODULE>
			<PAGE>index</PAGE>
			<KEYS>urla,id</KEYS>
			<TITLE>{title} - BLOG</TITLE>
	</FRIENDLYURL>
	<SHADOWBOX>handleOversize:"resize"</SHADOWBOX>
</[folder]>

Also, feel free to use "<div class="la_quote"> some important text </div>" on the body of your blog post for a fancy effect (you can add more changing the css)

You can add a _blogcustom.html in your base dir to add a custom area in the menu, you can name this with customareaname variable. This will most likelly be a permanent options menu. Note that at the INDEX, you will get a CONTENTMAN and CONTENTMAN2 for the main content and menu area "about"

--- MULTIPLE BLOGS:

You can have multiple blogs by adding fields on the meta data to separate them. Consider two blogs on folders blog1/ and blog2/

First, you must define which blog (folder) a certain blog (entry) is part of, for that, redeclare the blog metadata in YOUR meta.xml as follows:

<BLOG>
	<AREA mandatory="true">ENUM:'blog1','blog2'</AREA>
</BLOG>

Note that BLOG is already defined from the momment you enabled the affbi_blog, so by adding this to your meta.xml you are adding/changing fields. We added AREA so we can tag a given blog post as from blog1 or blog2

Second, when calling the blog at your config.php, you will require to specify there are two blogs. Just add the following lines:

$blog = $this->addPlugin('affbi_blog'); // loads the affbi_blog plugin, as usual
$blog->blogfolder = "blog1,blog2"; // change where the blog is located. Yes, it accepts multiple folders comma delimited

Now, on your pages.xml, you need to filter the friendlyURL to get blogs only from that folder. The pages.xml specified would look like (note we only added FILTER)

For the blog1 folder (only chante is at <FILTER>):

<BLOG1>
	<LINK>....,affbiblog.css</LINK>
	<FRIENDLYURL>
			<MODULE>blog</MODULE>
			<PAGE>index</PAGE>
			<KEYS>urla,id</KEYS>
			<TITLE>{title} - BLOG</TITLE>
			<FILTER>blog.area='blog1'</FILTER>
	</FRIENDLYURL>
	<SHADOWBOX>handleOversize:"resize"</SHADOWBOX>
</BLOG1>
	
For the blog2 folder (only change is at <FILTER>):

<BLOG2>
	<LINK>....,affbiblog.css</LINK>
	<FRIENDLYURL>
			<MODULE>blog</MODULE>
			<PAGE>index</PAGE>
			<KEYS>urla,id</KEYS>
			<TITLE>{title} - BLOG</TITLE>
			<FILTER>blog.area='blog2'</FILTER>
	</FRIENDLYURL>
	<SHADOWBOX>handleOversize:"resize"</SHADOWBOX>
</BLOG2>

And you are done
