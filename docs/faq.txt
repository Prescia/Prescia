CMS
---

My content manager results 404 but the page exists
> check the reason for the 404 on the debug bar of the bi_dev (or check all of them):
	>404 because of untreated virtualFolder at actions
		The page is not valid, check it again ... if the page was valid, onCheckActions of the cmd would trigger $core->ignore404
	>404 because of path not found at renderPage
	>404 because file not found
		Your default.php on either action or content changed the behaviour and disabled $core->ignore404, check it out
	>404 because template not found: _cms.html
		Most likelly you have no _cms.html set in root

CMS changes metadata/title after I set it on content
> The CMS runs after the content, so it will replace it unless you lock the title change with $core->storage['LOCKTITLE'] = true;

Loads the wrong frame
>The system per default loads the frame you specify at the root default.php. If you want a different one, you will have to code. Either create conditionals at the root default.php for your cms pages, or create the folder in the contents/ and put a new default.php loading the different frame

Loads an empty page
>The default.php that is running for your CMS is not calling the $this->loadTemplate() function (alas, this function must ALWAYS be called in your content code)

I have many virtual folders on the CMS, I want some to load different frames
>You will have to do that manually on the default.php, or extend your CMS to have which frame is to be served.

Modules/Plugins
---------------

My plugin function (like notifyevent) is not being called
>Make sure the pluging is properly connected to the module. It should be both ways: the module (XML) should point o the plugin in the "plugins" tag even if you load the plugin manually on PHP

404 page not found!?
--------------------

A page is returning 404, but it should exist!
> Enable the bi_dev plugin, this will add a bar at the bottom of your page that can be seen by clicking on the /\ symbol. The reason for any 404 will be there

I get a maintenance warning in my page
> Delete/rename the file maint.txt at root. It is supposed to be there only when you are actually performing maintenance where the server can still run

I get a 503 maintenance page
> Delete/rename the file heavymaint.html at root. It is supposed to be there only when you are actually performing maintenance where you don't want the server to run

Misc

What EconomicMode does?
> It disables a lot of high-level functions to improve performance. You will notice some, probably:
+ Disables nocache and forcecron request processing
+ Disables CONS_BOTPROTECT
+ Assume biggest caching times on cache control (twice for bots)
+ Disables logging of actions
+ Disables all bot logs
+ Disables benchmarking (from statistics)
+ Disables CONS_HONEYPOT trap (but still captures them)
